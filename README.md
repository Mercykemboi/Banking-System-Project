# Banking-System-Project

## Project Description
This is a banking system built using Python. The project allows a user to interact with their account through a set of operations such as checking balance, depositing money, withdrawing money, and exiting the system. It is designed to simulate a basic banking experience, using a command-line interface and basic Python functionalities.

## Features Implemented
 - **Check Balance**: Allows the user to check their current account balance.
 - **Deposit Money**: Allows the user to deposit money into their account. The deposit amount is validated to ensure it is a positive number.
- **Withdraw Money**: Allows the user to withdraw money from their account. The withdrawal amount is validated to ensure the user has sufficient balance.
- **Exit the System**: Terminates the session and exits the program.
